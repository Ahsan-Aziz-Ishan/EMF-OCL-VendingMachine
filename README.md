# EMF-OCL Vending Machine

This project demonstrates the application of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) principles for a vending machine system. It utilizes the EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) and OCL (Object Constraint Language) to model and validate the vending machine's behavior.

## Features

- A vending machine model based on MDE principles
- Use of EMF for meta-modeling
- OCL for constraints and validations

## Requirements

- Java 23
- Eclipse IDE with EMF and OCL plugins installed (IDE version: 2024-12)
- Eclipse OCL 6.22.0
- ATL 4.11.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
